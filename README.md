# Portfolio
the goal of this project is to use bootstrap to create a functioanl application with a responsive navbar, links, and images. 

# Directions

to initiate the project of creating a functional portfolio, I created the following files:

* Index.html
* Aboutme.html
* contact.html

I utilize Bootstrap to add a navbar containg the following links:
* home
* about me
* contacts

# home page
 I added an image with alt attribute. The alternate text will appear if the image cannot be display. This alternate text provides informatiin about the picture.

 # Aboutme

 On this page, we find a picture of myself with a small description of who i am and my reason to join Coding Bootcamp. 
 I was able to add the image using a facebook image address followed by a paragrapgh.

 # Contact Me
On this page I added an image with the same attributes. 
I also added rows and columns with the use of Bootstrap's grid system
finnally, I added my personal information with hyperlinks for my phone and email.

# Conclusion
the resul is a responsive design that works in different divices and different sizes of screens.
